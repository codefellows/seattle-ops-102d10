# Lab: Build a Computer

## Overview

Working with computer hardware is a common entry point into a bigger career in IT. By developing knowledge, skill, and ultimately expertise in computer hardware components, you will gradually learn what the components do and therefore have more confidence when it comes time to upgrade components, allocate resources to a cloud VM, or otherwise troubleshoot malfunctions on a single computer.

## Objectives

- Reassemble the lab computer
- Setup the monitor
- Test operational
- Identify external hardware interfaces

## Tasks

> IMPORTANT: When interacting with PC internals, think safety first. Always discharge static from your body before interacting with PC internals. Do not touch PC internals without checking that power is OFF and PSU set to 0.

- Start a new Google Doc for your lab submission and document each step while working through this lab.
- Copy and paste the lab instructions into your Google Doc and record your experience under each task.
  - Be sure to take note of any errors, their solutions and all resources used.

1. Place the computer on a clean flat surface (avoid carpet).
   - Remember to wear your antistatic wrist band, particularly if you have carpet flooring.
   - Double check that the PC external power is unplugged, and the Power Supply Unit (PSU) external switch is set to "0" for off. The computer should be powered OFF.

1. Install Random Access Memory (RAM).
   - Take a photo of the installed RAM.
   - Describe what you attempted, what worked/didn't work, and outcome.

1. Install a hard drive.
   - Take a photo of the installed hard drive.
   - Describe what you attempted, which interface connections were involved, what worked/didn't work, and the outcome.

1. Install rear case fan.
   - Describe what you attempted, which interface connections were involved, what worked/didn't work, and the outcome .

1. Install DVD-ROM drive.
   - Describe what you attempted, which interface connections were involved, what worked/didn't work, and the outcome.

1. If you were provided additional internal components in your lab kit, such as additional RAM or a SSD, install those components now.

1. Remove your antistatic wrist band. Setup the lab kit monitor, run video cable to monitor from PC. Plug power into the monitor.

1. Leaving the side panel off, plug the power cable into the back of the PC. Flip the power switch from 0 to 1. Press the PC front chassis power button to initiate a boot cycle and observe what happens on monitor.
   - Do not worry about loading the Operating System (OS) for now.

1. Take a photo of the startup sequence video feed displayed by your monitor. If you are not receiving a video signal, correct the issue by confirming the monitor is powered and turned on, and that your video cable is correctly installed to both the monitor and the PC video out interface.

1. Take a photo showing the installed DVD-ROM drive is ejecting/operating as expected. If not, correct the issue by powering off the computer, removing external power cable, flipping PSU from 1 to 0, wearing your antistatic wrist band, and troubleshooting the power and data cabling on your DVD-ROM drive.

1. Take a photo of the installed rear case fan.
   - Describe what direction the air flows when you power the PC on. Air should be flowing out of the case. If not, correct the issue by powering off the computer, removing external power cable, flipping PSU from 1 to 0, wearing your antistatic wrist band, and troubleshooting the direction and/or power cabling of your rear case fan.

1. Hold the front power button to force-shutdown the PC. Assess your inventory. At this stage, you should have the case side panel(s) removed and the screws associated with the side panel(s). All other internal components should be installed.

1. Take a photo of the front of the PC case where there are external hardware interfaces. In your Google Doc, list all interfaces and what they do.

1. Take a photo of the back of the PC case (by the I/O shield) where there are external hardware interfaces. In your Google Doc, list all interfaces and what they do.

Test and confirm the computer is working properly.
