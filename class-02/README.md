## Overview

Today weâ€™re going to disassemble, maybe upgrade a few parts and then re-assembling the lab PC. We'll also explore hardware interfaces and identify them in lab.

## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we set up our Reading Notes repo.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be upgrading our lab computer's hardware and modifiying it's performance.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on the start up sequence and explore the BIOS of our lab computers.

## Build a Computer

### Why
- Building a computer involves troubleshooting. Not everything always works perfectly the first time. Learning to diagnose and fix issues hones your problem-solving skills.
- When you build your own computer, you can customize it to your specific needs. This is especially important for gamers, video editors, and other professionals who require high-performance machines tailored to their tasks.
- Building your own computer can be more cost-effective than buying a pre-built one, especially if you need high-end components. You pay for what you need, not for pre-installed software or brand names.
- You understand how the components fit together, so when it's time to upgrade, you can do it yourself. This can save you money in the long run, as well as reduce electronic waste by extending the lifespan of your computer.
- Understanding how hardware and software interact can be crucial. It can help you optimize your system for better performance and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

### What
- Central Processing Unit (CPU): The primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside the computer.
- Motherboard: The main circuit board containing the central components of the computer, including the CPU, memory, and connectors for other hardware.
- Random Access Memory (RAM): Temporary memory that the computer uses to store data that is frequently accessed or that needs to be accessed quickly.
- Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and Solid State Drive (SSD): Storage devices used to store data, files, and the operating system. HDDs use magnetic storage, while SSDs use flash memory for faster data access.
- Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): A specialized electronic circuit designed to accelerate the processing of images and videos in a frame buffer intended for output to a display.
- Power Supply Unit (PSU): A hardware component that supplies power to the computer's components.
- Heat Sink and Fan: Components used to dissipate heat from the CPU and other high-temperature components.
- SATA, PCIe, USB, HDMI: Different types of interfaces used for connecting various hardware components.
- Peripheral Devices: Devices such as keyboards, mice, monitors, and printers connected to the computer.
- Overclocking: The process of increasing a computer component's clock rate, running it at a higher speed than it was designed for.
- Static Electricity: A stationary electric charge, typically produced by friction, that causes sparks or crackling or the attraction of dust or hair.
- Cable Management: The process of organizing and managing cables inside a computer case to improve airflow and aesthetics.

### How
The different components of a computer work together in a coordinated manner to perform various tasks and execute software applications. Here's how the interaction typically occurs:
- Boot-up
  - When you turn on the computer, the CPU reads instructions from the BIOS/UEFI stored in the motherboard. These instructions initiate the boot process, loading the operating system from the storage device into the computer's memory (RAM).
- Loading Applications
  - When you launch a software application, the CPU fetches the necessary instructions and data from the storage device and loads them into the RAM for faster access. As you interact with the application, the CPU processes your input, performs calculations, and manages data in the RAM.
- Data Processing
  - The CPU fetches and processes data from the RAM, performing calculations and executing instructions. If the application requires graphical processing, the CPU works in tandem with the GPU to render images and videos.
- Saving Data
  - When you save a file, the CPU processes the data, and it is written back to the storage device for permanent storage.
- Displaying Output
  - The processed data is sent to the output devices (monitor, printer, speakers), allowing you to see or hear the results of your actions on the computer.
