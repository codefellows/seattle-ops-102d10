# Class 02

## Class Outline

1. Ops 102 Overview
1. Review
1. Lecture
1. Demo
1. Lab 

## Overview

Today weâ€™re going to disassemble, maybe upgrade a few parts and then re-assembling the lab PC. We'll also explore hardware interfaces and identify them in lab.

## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we set up our Reading Notes repo.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be upgrading our lab computer's hardware and modifiying it's performance.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on the start up sequence and explore the BIOS of our lab computers.

## Build a Computer

### Why
- Building computers drives technological progress.
- Building a computer allows for customization and optimization based on specific needs.
- Building a computer can be more cost-effective than purchasing a pre-built system, especially for specialized applications. 
- Building a computer fosters innovation and experimentation.
- Building a computer can contribute to sustainability efforts by carefully selecting components and prioritizing energy efficiency and reduce electronic waste. 

### What
- What are levels of Abstraction?
- What are the 3 stages of computing?
- How many bits make up a byte?
- List the differences between the User Interface, Software Interface and the Hard Interface.
- Is HDD or SSD faster? Why?
- Volatile vs non-volatile memory
- Why is it important to discharge static electricity before touching the motherboard?

### How
- In today's lab, you will be expected to identify, describe and define these terms and concepts:
  - CPU
  - motherboard
  - RAM
  - storage device
  - GPU
  - PSU
  - cooling solution
  - interface connectivity
  - case and peripherals

### Experimentation and Discovery Ideas
- What happens if you mix-and-match RAM sticks?
- What components require specific compatibility with other components?
- Does a virtual computer needs all the same hardware parts?  
- How to start to troubleshoot bad hardware like faulty RAM, an overheating CPU, or an incompatible graphics card?

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Interfaces
- USB
- Video Interfaces
- Portable Media
- Analog vs Digital
- CMOS

#### Execute

- Students should be able to describe and define the major components of a computer, such as the CPU, motherboard, RAM, storage devices (HDD, SSD), GPU, PSU, cooling systems, and peripherals.
- Students should understand the functions of each component and how they interact with each other. 
- Students should be familiar with the specifications of different components. 
- Students should be able to explain how to check compatibility based on factors like socket types (for CPUs), form factors (for motherboards and cases), power requirements, and connectivity options.
- Students should be able to describe the process of assembling a computer.
- Students should be able to identify and describe common hardware issues and troubleshooting methods.
- They should have knowledge of techniques for optimizing computer performance, such as overclocking, adjusting power settings, managing software and drivers, and implementing cooling solutions.
