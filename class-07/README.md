# Lab: Network Connectivity 

## Overview

To use the Ubuntu PC as a true dedicated virtualization server, we'll need to next establish reliable network connectivity to it from our personal computer. To do this, we'll need to apply networking concepts such as IP addressing, ports, and MAC addressing. We'll also need to install some additional software on the Ubuntu box to facilitate these network protocols. After configuring and testing remote connectivity to your Ubuntu virtualization server, you'll no longer need to keep it around your desktop workspace and can relocate to a closet or garage with network access. Think of it as your "private cloud," but without the costs!

> The operations depicted in this lab are quite common in the world of networking and systems administration. Most servers are reserved or static IPs, and in this cloud-driven market we're seeing heavy usage of remote desktop solutions such as Microsoft RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).
