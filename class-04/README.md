# Installing Ubuntu Linux OS

## Overview

Your home lab PC will be acting as a virtualization server for the duration of the Ops sequence. For this reason, we'll be using Ubuntu Linux as the computer's base operating system to capitalize on its lightweight, resource-efficient performance. We can later use the software application, Virtualbox, to "spin up" any other operating systems we may need, such as Windows 10.
