## Class Outline

1. Ops 102 Overview
1. Review
1. Lecture
1. Demo
1. Lab 

## Overview

Your home lab PC will be acting as a virtualization server for the duration of the Ops sequence. For this reason, we'll be using Ubuntu Linux as the computer's base operating system to capitalize on its lightweight, resource-efficient performance. We can later use the software application, Virtualbox, to "spin up" any other operating systems we may need, such as Windows 10.

## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we removed the CMOS battery to clear previous BIOS settings so that we could reconfigure them.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be installing the Ubuntu OS onto our lab computers.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on updating your OS and installing applications.

## Topic Name Here

### Why
- This topic is important because it forms the foundation of our virtualization server setup.
-By installing the Ubuntu Linux OS, we create a stable and lightweight base for running virtual machines.

### What
- What is the purpose of running Ubuntu on our lab computers?
- What is the software that creates the bootable Ubuntu USB drive called?
- What does "LTS" mean?
- Do you need to change the boot order after Ubuntu has been installed? Why or why not?

### How
- In today's lab, you will create a bootable Ubuntu USB drive in order to install Ubuntu OS onto your lab computer.

### Experimentation and Discovery Ideas
- Why do operating systems have versions?
- What are the differences between Windows Home and Windows Pro editions?
