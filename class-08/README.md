# Virtualization of Windows OS

## Overview

Now that Virtualbox is loaded onto your Ubuntu-based lab PC, you'll be able to create a "virtual machine" of any operating system, assuming you can get your hands on the corresponding .iso installer or a premade .ova Virtualbox file. There are legal and ethical considerations to make when seeking out such files. For example, Apple forbids the virtualization of its macOS on non-Apple hardware. For this class, your first VM will be Windows 10, the most common enterprise business desktop used today.
