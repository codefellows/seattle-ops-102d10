# Startup Sequences and BIOS

Today we’re taking a closer look at the startup sequence of a computer. Familiarity with the “lower level” operations of a computer will be very relevant to a support technician who encounters various issues with computers and must isolate problems, and who also may be reconfiguring hardware components such as hard drives. This lab will be very much sandbox learning; students will likely encounter all sorts of problems.
