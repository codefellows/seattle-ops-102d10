# Lab: Installing Virtualbox with Linux Terminal

## Overview

In order to effectively utilize Ubuntu Linux as a virtualization server, you'll need to get comfortable using the Linux terminal. While many operations can be performed using the desktop graphical user interface (GUI), basic Linux terminal skills are generally expected of Ops professionals.

## Objectives

On your Ubuntu Linux box:
- Establish internet connectivity to your lab kit PC
- Perform an APT package manager update
- Follow the Ops [Computer Setup Instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/) to install applications and configure your machine
- Open VirtualBox Manager

## Tasks

- Start a new Google Doc for your lab submission and document each step while working through this lab.
- Copy and paste the lab instructions into your Google Doc and record your experience under each task.
  - Be sure to take note of any errors, their solutions and all resources used.

### Part 1: Network Connectivity

First, check that your lab PC is connected to your home network via ethernet or Wi-Fi. Then, use the Ubuntu desktop GUI to update the Ubuntu OS to the latest version.
- On the back of the lab kit PC, on its I/O shield, you'll find the ethernet port. Plug an ethernet cable into the back of the PC and run it to your home router/modem.
  - If you need an ethernet cable, check the items in your lab kit: you should have received a 20ft ethernet cable and a 100ft ethernet cable. Additionally, a shorter cable should have come packaged with the router.
- Alternatively, your lab computer likely has built-in wifi, but that is not a guarantee, and you will eventually need to make an ethernet connection to ensure stable, fast connections.
- Include in your lab submission an explination of how this part of the lab went for you and any issues/blockers you encountered.

### Part 2: Setup Lab Environment

Open [Computer Setup Instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/) on your lab computer and follow the link for the "Ops and Cybersecurity Course" near the bottom of the page.

Follow the instructions in the setup guide **exactly**. To reduce errors, copy and paste each command into the Linux Terminal.

_**Note:** copy/paste works slightly differently in Linux than it does on Windows and Mac. If you're having trouble, check out [this guide](https://linuxconfig.org/copy-and-paste-text-into-the-terminal-on-ubuntu-20-04)._

These instructions include installing and enabling apps and configuring system settings. If you're curious what a command does, query your favorite chatbot or use Google to research it.

Include a photo of your Linux Terminal before moving onto the next page in the Setup Guide. Graders are looking for either error messages or success messages and to see if you've entered the commands correctly. Not all commands will return a success message.

By the end of this lab, you'll have a fully updated Ubuntu Linux OS with Virtualbox and internet connectivity.

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

Have a macOS computer at home? Find the terminal application in macOS and try some of the operations from part 1 and 2. You might be surprised at how much macOS and Ubuntu have in common. Include in your submission what commands seemed to differ between the operating systems.

## Submission Instructions

1. Name the document according to your course code and assignment.
   - i.e. `seattle-ops-102d33: Lab 04`.
1. Add your name & date at the top of the Google Doc.
1. Share your Google Doc so that "Anyone with the link can view".
1. Paste the link to your Google Doc in the discussion field below and share an observation from your experience in this lab including how long this lab took to complete.
