# Lab: SOHO Networking & Development Tools

Routers, hosts, and IP addressing form the basics of a SOHO (small or home office) network.

## Objectives

- Deploy a small office/home office (SOHO) router and configure it to broadcast a secure wireless network.

## Resources

## Tasks

- Start a new Google Doc for your lab submission and document each step while working through this lab.
- Copy and paste the lab instructions into your Google Doc and record your experience under each task.
  - Be sure to take note of any errors, their solutions and any resources used.

### SOHO Router Setup

- Power on your lab kit router near your computer workspace.
- Router will begin broadcasting a Wi-FI network.
- Plug in a computer to the router via Ethernet cable or connect your computer to the Wi-Fi network and open the router's configuration web portal at its IP address.
- Login using default credentials, then change the password to the router configuration web portal to "codefellows2020###".
- Configure a Wi-Fi network broadcasting SSID "ops102".
- Select the most secure Security Mode. Require the password "learnmorefaster".
  - Include a screenshot of the "Wireless Security" configuration in your Google Doc.
  - Describe what Security Mode you selected and justify why.
- If you have an ethernet jack with internet service nearby, plug the router's WAN port into an existing network via Ethernet cable to transmit internet connectivity through the router. This will create a lab-only sub-network. This step is not required to complete this lab.
- If you have not done so already, connect a Wi-Fi device to the "ops102" Wi-Fi network.
- On the router configuration web portal, locate the DHCP Active IP Table, which lists all currently connected computers.
  - Include a screenshot of the DHCP Active IP Table in your Google Doc.
    - Describe what you see here and what it means.

### Stretch Goal

To complete the Stretch Goals, go back to your SOHO router setup and work through the following:

- Include a screenshot of the Status > Router screen in your Google Doc.
  - Describe what each attribute here means to the best of your ability (e.g. Firmware Version is which firmware version this router is using).
- Deploy a wireless hotspot from your mobile phone
  - Describe the extent to which you can configure the wireless hotspot.
  - Describe how this differs from configuring a SOHO router.
  - Describe what security concerns may arise in using a wireless hotspot from your mobile phone.
