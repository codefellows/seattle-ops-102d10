## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
Previously, you may have attended the Ops 101 course where you learned what the IT, networking and cybersecurity industry is all about! 

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be focusing on setting up our tools for lab and getting comfortable in the new classroom spaces.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class we will disassemble our lab computers, take an inventory of every component, maybe upgrade some pieces and then reassemble it!
